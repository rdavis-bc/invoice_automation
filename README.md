## Overview 
Just used for extracting the sheets from a spreadsheet and placing them in their own appropriately titled PDF
## Prerequisites
1. Python 
    * To check if downloaded you can run `python3 --version`
    * If not downloaded then go to the official website [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.10/python-3.9.10-macos11.pkg) and download version **3.9.10**
2. Git
    * To check if downloaded you can run `git --version`
3. Excel (ofc)
## Set-up
1. git clone this repo using the command `git clone https://github.com/rdavis-bc/invoice_automation.git`
2. Then move into the directory using `cd invoice_automation`
3. create a python environment with `python3 -m venv <Any name you want>` so for example `python3 -m venv excel_venv`
4. Activate the environment with the command `source <environment name>/bin/activate`
5. Install the needed libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Once those have finished installing , make a directory to place your excel workbooks and another directory for your pdfs
> For example you can create a structure like the following ![ok](images/Screen%20Shot%202022-03-23%20at%2011.52.23%20AM.png) where there is a subdirectory called `excel_sheets` and in this folder we place our `.xlsx` files . Moreoever, we have another subdirectory called excel_pdfs where the pdfs will go.
7. So inside `invoice_automation` we can just run a command with the following format `python src.main.py <directory of xlsx> <directory for pdfs>`
> Note: Some errors will pop up in the command line but these aren't important for the time being
